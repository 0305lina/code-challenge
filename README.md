# Code Challenge Repo

## Purpose
This repository is to review the Data Structures and Algorithm that I self-taught every day to do better in coding tests.

## Goal
1. Review the previous materials and add new problem every single day.
2. Understand the problem until I can explain to others.
3. Comment most lines so that other developers could also understand every details.
